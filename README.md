# Cole_2018_cyclebycycle
Analysis code to create the figures in "Cycle by cycle analysis of neural oscillations" [Cole & Voytek 2018, bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/16/302000) Each notebook corresponds to 1 figure in the paper.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: bycycle and neurodsp
The original code relied heavily on [neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp), a toolbox for analyzing neural oscillations, to do the cycle-by-cycle analysis.

However, the cycle-by-cycle analysis functionality has now been moved to [bycycle](https://github.com/bycycle-tools/bycycle), so I suggest you use this in the future. Bycycle is used for the most recent version of the manuscript, which has not completed the peer-review process yet, and you can find updated code in the [v2 branch](https://github.com/voytekresearch/Cole_2018_cyclebycycle/tree/v2) of this repo (note figures have changed).
