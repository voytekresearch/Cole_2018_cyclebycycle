Analysis code to create the figures in "Cycle by cycle analysis of neural oscillations" [Cole & Voytek 2018, bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/16/302000)

Each notebook corresponds to 1 figure in the paper. The code heavily utilizes libraries in [neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp), a toolbox for analyzing neural oscillations.
