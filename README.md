# Cole_2018_cyclebycycle
Analysis code to create the figures in "Cycle by cycle analysis of neural oscillations" [Cole & Voytek 2019, J Neurophys](https://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jn.00273.2019?journalCode=jn) Each notebook corresponds to 1 figure in the paper.

# NOTE: neurodsp errors
If you are using a newer version of neurodsp (2.0 or later), I expect there to be some errors because this project was written using neurodsp 1.0.
