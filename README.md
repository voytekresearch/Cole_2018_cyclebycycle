# Cole_2018_cyclebycycle
Analysis code to create the figures in "Cycle by cycle analysis of neural oscillations" [Cole & Voytek 2018, bioRxiv] (link TBD)

Each notebook corresponds to 1 figure in the paper. The code heavily utilizes libraries in [neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp), a toolbox for analyzing neural oscillations.
